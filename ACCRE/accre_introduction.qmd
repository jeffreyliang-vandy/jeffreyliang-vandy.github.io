## Do you have these situations?

-   Do you have a 8G/16G laptop and screaming at it/yourself when you try to load a imaging/EHR/Genomic data?

-   Do you max out your laptop's fan doing simulation during class and all the people are looking at you (Yeji)

-   Or do you have 100,000,000,000 simulations need to run and so afraid to close your laptop/want to speed it up?

-   Or you just want to be cool

## ACCRE!!

> It's a cluster, with a lot of CPU and even more RAM than you need

## Why people not using ACCRE {auto-animate="true"}

> It's Linux

## This is Linux {auto-animate="true"}

I promise you you will not see a single line of linux code for the first 1/3 of this tutorial

-   Rstudio Server and Jupyter are your friends and most efficient workspace in ACCRE

-   Don't even try the desktop it's horrible

## See it's not that bad

-   With Rstudio and Jupyter Notebook you can gain access to the CPU and RAM you need for your code-writing

-   No a single line of Linux code so far

## Background Job

This is the most powerful tools of ACCRE

> Run code, go to sleep

-   How to use SCREEN
-   How to use slurm
-   How to use slurm to run 1000 simulation simultaneously

## Screen

There's a very simple tutorial [here](https://geeksforgeeks.org/screen-command-in-linux-with-examples/){preview-link="auto"}

After installed screen

::: fragment
```{bash}
screen
Rscript This_is_an_example.R
#Ctrl+A+D
```
:::

::: fragment
Then you can goes back and check if it is finished

```{bash}
screen -ls #this will give you the job id
screen -r job_id
#Job Done
#Ctrl+D
```

## [Slurm](https://portal.accre.vanderbilt.edu/pun/sys/dashboard/batch_connect/sessions)

A tutorial is [here](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/accre/documentation/slurm/){preview-link="true"}

> Slurm allows you to run as much simulations as you want in the background, simultaneously\*

All you need is

1.  You simulation code(\*.R,\*.python)
2.  A slurm file(Don't worry, they have templates [there](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/accre/documentation/slurm/){preview-link="true"})

## [Parallel Job!!!](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/accre/documentation/parallel/#multithreaded-jobs){preview-link="true"}

> This is how ACCRE going to boost your research to meet the deadline every Friday

Same for slurm,

There is a [tutorial](https://github.com/accre/R/tree/master/parallel-workshop){preview-link="true"} of how to do Parallel computing in ACCRE

## Environments

> If you are afraid of Linux, more like you are afraid of building the environment

-   In ACCRE, environment was built and load with `module` . It is easy to use, but most of the time it is out-of-date(R is 4.0.5)

-   `conda`/[`mamba`](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge){preview-link="true"} is the easiest way to build a custom environment

-   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/){preview-link="true"} container is my recommended way to build environment

Links for installation were attached

## Module & Mamba

::: {.fragment fragment-index="1"}
Using Mamba

```{bash}
### In the terminal
mamba install r-base-4.3.2 r-tidyverse
```

EASY
:::

::: {.fragment fragment-index="2"}
Using Module

```{bash}
### In the terminal
### Loading R environment
module load GCC OpenMPI R R-bundle-Bioconductor
### Installing R Packages into your home directory
mkdir -p ~/R/rlib-4.0.5
```
:::

::: {.fragment fragment-index="3"}
```{bash}
### In the R
.libPaths("~/R/rlib-4.0.5")
install.packages(tidyverse)
```

Unfortunately the Rstudio in ACCRE only use this one

## Docker {auto-animate="true"}

> This has a little bit of learning curve, but once you know how to do it, you. can do this:

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}

A tutorial of Singularity(Accre's Docker) is [here](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/accre/documentation/singularity/){preview-link="true"}

## Docker {auto-animate="true"}

[Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/)

## Summary {auto-animate="true"}

ACCRE itself was built to be used with minimal knowledge of Linux

But you can expand what you can do with ACCRE with a little bit of exploring the linux world

So go ahead and apply for an [account](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/accre/getting-started/). It comes with a training module that takes less than 1hr and very helpful.
