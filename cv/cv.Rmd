## RESEARCH EXPERIENCE
- **Case Study: eHealth Resource Allocation in Shandong Province** 
\hfill Jinan, China\newline
  _Lead Researcher; Advisor: Prof. Jiajia Li_ \hfill 01/2019-06/2019
  * Led a research team to collect data on the use of electronic health (eHealth) resources from an
online healthcare community involving more than 441,000 doctors and 31 provinces in China,
by using Python packages, such as lxml and pandas.
  * Cleaned and analyzed data with R-ggplot; utilized techniques such as visualizing the spatial
distribution and density of highly-ranked hospitals and experienced professionals.
  * Performed statistical analysis on eHealth online-to-offline spillover effects using the Spatial
Durbin Panel Model to reduce autocorrelation by the Pesaran CD test; improved model fitness.
  * Identified the spillover effects of eHealth services on health care inequity; provided ideas and
strategies to address healthcare disparities using widely accessible eHealth resources.
  * Drafted and submitted a report to the 2020 Health Technology Assessment International
Conference and 2019 Global Young Scholars Forum on Health Management

- **Project: Effect of Insurance Plans on Catastrophic Healthcare Expenditures**
\hfill Jinan, China\newline
  _Lead Researcher; Advisor: Prof. Jiajia Li_ \hfill 10/2018-06/2019
  * Led a research group to conduct a longitudinal study on the effects of different insurance types
on catastrophic healthcare expenditures.
  * Conducted data cleansing and validation using R package â€“ tidyverse; processed information
from 44,417 observational sessions and identified 3,300 missing units of data and outliers.
  * Collected information on geographical locations with Google Maps API and matched this with
the insurance coverage provided by each plan as an instrumental variable for addressing the
endogeneity introduced by insurance selection bias.
  * Performed two-stage least square regression analysis to build a model with instrumental
variables using R package -AER; concluded that China's new health insurance program has
decreased the odds of catastrophic health expenditures but has failed to control total health
expenditures.
  * Provided quantitative evidence to forecast the financial expenditures of different healthcare
insurance plans and to provide a reference for other researchers in the selection of instrumental
variables.

- **Mapping Health: Tracking Population Health in Shandong Province, China** 
\hfill Jinan, China\newline
_Research Assistant; Advisor: Dr. Fuzhong Xue_ \hfill 06/2018-11/2018
  * Refined medical information from more than 161 handbooks on atrial fibrillation and
hypercholesterolemia; coded them into a graph database that covered more than 3,000 specific
nodes and relationships.
  * Designed and constructed a Knowledge Graph in Neo4j, including processes for screening,
diagnosis, treatment, and education.

- **Urban-Rural Disparities in Catastrophic Health Expenditures in China**
\hfill Jinan,China\newline
_Lead Researcher; Advisor: Prof. Jiajia Li_ \hfill 03/2018-10/2018
  * Compared datasets with 44,417 observational sessions with individuals and 11,130
observational sessions with households from the ten waves of the China Health and Nutrition
Survey (CHNS); examined registered residency status using R package-tidyverse.
  * Calculated prevalence of catastrophic healthcare expenditures since 1989 in households with
chronic disease patients, and used this as a response variable; created an interaction of time with
rural-urban identities as an independent variable to use in future regression analysis.
  * Performed logistics regression, concluding that healthcare disparities have diminished due to the
development of financial protection and rising standard of living, but that actual risk has not
been significantly reduced.
  * Conducted a review of China's Health Reform progress and promoted critical illness insurance
among rural populations.
  * Drafted a paper summarizing findings which was accepted by the 2019 International Health
Economics Association and 2018 Healthcare Management Forum, hosted by Chinese Preventive
Medicine Association.
