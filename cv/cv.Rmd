- **Department of Biostatistics, Columbia University**
\hfill New York\newline
  _Research Assistant, Advisor: Prof. Shuang Wang_ \hfill 04/2021-PRESENT\newline
  **Methodology Developing on Multi-omic Association and Clustering **
  * Literature review on dimensional reduction, discrete time random walk and multi-view clustering method
  * Design simulation to test and compare existing multi-view clustering method, ie. Similarity Network Fusion(SNF), Multi-view Clustering Without Parameter(COMIC) etc.; and association boosting method, ie. Disease-Specific Network Enhancement Prioritization(DISNEP), Gene-wanderer etc.
  * Improving above-mentioned methods with alternative manifold learning for new data representation, smoothing learned similarity matrix, multi-view fusion or consensus regulation, complementary regualtion on clustering result

  **Predicting Patient Coherence with Multivariate Random Forest**
  * Design and build costumed multivariate random forest algorithm for interval drug compliance prediction for a incomplete and class imbalance longitudinal;
  * Modeling missing pattern of the response variables under MAR, and boosting compliance prediction model's performance with the modeled missing observation probability;
  * Design simulation study to test algorithm performance and analysis on the data
  * Manuscript writing

\hfill Jinan, China\newline
  _Research Assistant, Advisor: Prof. Jiajia Li_ \hfill 01/2019-06/2019\newline
  **Case Study: eHealth Resource Allocation Inequality in Shandong Province** 
  * Led a research group to collect data on the use of electronic health (eHealth) resources from an
online healthcare community involving more than 441,000 doctors and 31 provinces in China,
by using Python packages, such as lxml and pandas.
  * Cleaned and analyzed data with R-ggplot; utilized techniques such as visualizing the spatial
distribution and density of highly-ranked hospitals and experienced professionals.
  * Performed statistical analysis on eHealth online-to-offline spillover effects using the Spatial
Durbin Panel Model to reduce autocorrelation by the Pesaran CD test; improved model fitness.
  * Identified the spillover effects of eHealth services on health care inequity; provided ideas and
strategies to address healthcare disparities using widely accessible eHealth resources.
  * Drafted and submitted a report to the 2020 Health Technology Assessment International
Conference and 2019 Global Young Scholars Forum on Health Management

  _Research Assistant, Advisor: Prof. Jiajia Li_ \hfill 10/2018-06/2019\newline
  **Project: Effect of Insurance Plans on Catastrophic Healthcare Expenditures**
  * Led a research group to conduct a longitudinal study on the effects of different insurance types
on catastrophic healthcare expenditures.
  * Conducted data cleansing and validation using R package – tidyverse; processed information
from 44,417 observational sessions and identified 3,300 missing units of data and outliers.
  * Collected information on geographical locations with Google Maps API and matched this with
the insurance coverage provided by each plan as an instrumental variable for addressing the
endogeneity introduced by insurance selection bias.
  * Performed two-stage least square regression analysis to build a model with instrumental
variables using R package -AER; concluded that China's new health insurance program has
decreased the odds of catastrophic health expenditures but has failed to control total health
expenditures.
  * Provided quantitative evidence to forecast the financial expenditures of different healthcare
insurance plans and to provide a reference for other researchers in the selection of instrumental
variables.

<!-- \hfill Jinan,China\newline -->
<!-- _Lead Researcher; Advisor: Prof. Jiajia Li_ \hfill 03/2018-10/2018 -->
<!--   * Compared datasets with 44,417 observational sessions with individuals and 11,130 -->
<!-- observational sessions with households from the ten waves of the China Health and Nutrition -->
<!-- Survey (CHNS); examined registered residency status using R package-tidyverse. -->
<!--   * Calculated prevalence of catastrophic healthcare expenditures since 1989 in households with -->
<!-- chronic disease patients, and used this as a response variable; created an interaction of time with -->
<!-- rural-urban identities as an independent variable to use in future regression analysis. -->
<!--   * Performed logistics regression, concluding that healthcare disparities have diminished due to the -->

<!--   * Conducted a review of China's Health Reform progress and promoted critical illness insurance -->
